# Full IoT product example

This repository contains the implementation of the full, functional commercial IoT product.
It utilises the power of [Mongoose OS](https://mongoose-os.com) and can be used as a reference for creating other similar products.

This project implements a smart light. For the hardware, we use a development board with an LED, which serves as a light. The devboard can be
"shipped" to a customer, which provisions it using
a mobile app. You, as a vendor, have full control
over all "shipped" products, including device
dashboard with remote firmware updates, remote management and usage statistics.

This short video demonstrates the use case:
